# Gulp Starter

WIP

Gulp file with common tasks to get started

Make sure NPM is installed. If it isn't, you will need to run this first (assuming you have homebrew installed):

```
brew install node
```

Once you have npm installed, you just need to clone this repository and install all dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:spentacular/gulp-starter.git YourProject
cd YourProject
rm -rf .git
npm install
```

Then, all you need to do is run either `gulp` or `npm start` to watch the files in your directories!

A task is set up to build all files out as well, by running `gulp build` or `npm build`

That's it!

If you have any tasks you would like to see added, or any issues you have with the file, please just make an issue and I will get them added/changed!
